# ArcProportion

A new Python visualization library for arc charts


### Current Features

Basic arc chart:  list items along the x-axis and draw arcs to show relationships. Comes with
-- Collision reduction:  use algorithms to minimize arc crossings in visualization 
-- Pandas support:  data can be passed in as a dataframe with minimal additional customization needed
-- Arc customization:  arc colors and widths can be specified


### Future Features

"Fountain" chart:  single source, show part-to-whole relationships to destinations

Proportional arc chart:  show part to whole relationships among many sources (ins and outs must equal total value assigned to node)

**Bonus**:  chord charts (wrap arc charts in a circle)


### Requirements

Pandas

Matplotlib
