# Algorithm
## Implementation
[x] Implement `node_count_crossing` algorithm
[ ]

## Optimization
[ ] Change Adj. Matrix implementation to Adj. List (`count crossings`)

# Visualization
[ ]

# Software Infrastructure
[ ] Decide on codebase structure:
- Divide modules into algorithm, visualization interface and user API?
[ ] Refactorize tests and demos
[ ] Move code to `src` or equivalent directory/folder

# Package Management
[ ] Choose license (MIT?)
[ ] Create `pyproject.toml` file for build
[ ] Decide on package name
